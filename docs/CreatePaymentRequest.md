Name | Type | Description | Notes

**currency** | **str** | Three-letter [ISO currency code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217), in uppercase. Must be a supported currency. | 
**order_id** | **str** | An order ID from your system. A unique identifier that can be used to reconcile the payment with your internal system. | 
**callback_url** | **str** | The URL to which a payment result should be sent asynchronously. | 
**complete_url** | **str** | The URL the customer will be directed to after transaction completed (successful or failed - except if &#x60;failUrl&#x60; is provided). | 
**fail_url** | **str** | The URL the customer will be directed to after transaction has failed, instead of &#x60;completeUrl&#x60; (used in hosted payment page). This allows to provide two different URLs for successful and failed payments. | [optional]

**session_id** | **str** | A unique identifier within your system that adds security to the payment process.
